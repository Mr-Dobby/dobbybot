# Setup
Dobby bot source code

First all-in-one Discord bot (made by me) with database included.
This is under development for whenever I feel like killing time.
Setup after downloading .zip:

• 1. Make sure you got MongoDB local server installed: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

• 2. Make sure you have NodeJS installed: https://nodejs.org/en/

• 3. Create a new file in the same directory called ".env" and type in "TOKEN=YOUR-BOTS-TOKEN" - Get your bot token on dev portal.

• 4. Double click 'Start_Bot.cmd' - Edit this file to your desired OS if you're not on Windows (.sh).

• 4.1 Open a terminal/powershell window in the directory and type npm install - If fails, get packages online instead

• 4.2 If they fail to install, find the package name on https://www.npmjs.com/ and install them through their own guides.

• 5. ez pez you good to go. Login to your MongoDB as localhost.

Or just invite this, with 99%% uptime: https://bit.ly/2KzZSbV
Note: I LOVE custom emotes. You might want to change quite a bit for it to fit.
