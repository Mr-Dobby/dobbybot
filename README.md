# Setup
Dobby bot source code

First all-in-one Discord bot (made by me) with database included.

Feel like trying? Feel free to. Still under development for whenever I feel like killing time.
Setup after downloading:
1. Make sure you got MongoDB local server installed: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
2. Make sure you have NodeJS installed: https://nodejs.org/en/
3. Create a new file in the same directory called ".env" and type in "TOKEN=YOUR-BOTS-TOKEN" - Get your bot token on dev portal.
4. Double click 'Start_Bot.cmd' - Edit this file to your desired OS id you're not on Windows.
4.1 It will most likely fail, simply install all the modules it fails on with; Open PowerShell/Terminal and type npm install PACKAGE_NAME
4.2 If they fail to install, find the package name on https://www.npmjs.com/ and install them through their own guides.
5. ez pez you good to go. Login to your MongoDB as localhost.
